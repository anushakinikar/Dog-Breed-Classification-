Dog Breed Classification Using Deep Learning

This project implements a deep learning-based model to classify dog breeds from images. The goal is to develop a system capable of recognizing and differentiating between multiple dog breeds based on visual features using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

Key Components:
Dataset: The project uses a large dataset of labeled dog images with various breeds. 

Model Architecture: A CNN model is utilized for image classification.
